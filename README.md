# Hitchhiker’s Guide to Domino on Linux

**Don't panic — just deploy.**

Domino on Linux can be simple, powerful, and extremely stable — if you combine the right OS practices, platform components, automation workflows, container strategies, and integration patterns.
This project documents a practical, proven approach to running Domino on Linux, based on many years of real-world deployment, troubleshooting, automation and operations experience.

This project brings together the essential components, tools, and practices needed to build a complete and reliable environment.
From operating system preparation and infrastructure services to Domino deployment, automation, and modern platform integration native and in containers on Docker and Kubernetes.

Rather than duplicating existing documentation, this project references and integrates related tools, solutions, and repositories.
Where separate projects exist, this guide points to them. Where configuration, orchestration, or deployment requires a full working example across components, this project provides opinionated and practical end-to-end scenarios.
